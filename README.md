The only YouTube channels I followed for system design during my interviews an year ago. 

1) Sandeep Kaul - codeKarle
2) Gaurav Sen 
3) Narendra L - Tech Dummies Narendra L
4) Yogita Sharma - sudoCODE
5) The Tech Granth

These are the ONLY YouTube channels I followed to learn system design from scratch and cracked atleast 20+ system design interviews. 

However, there are quite a lot of channels for system design and interviews now and I havenâ€™t looked at their content much to provide an opinion.
